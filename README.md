## Platform Independence:
Java is a platform-independent language because:
- In any programming language, source code is compiled into executable code, which cannot run across all platforms.
- When Java compiles a program, it generates an executable file called a **.class** file. This class file contains **byte codes**.
- **Byte-code** is a special format of machine-level code [intermediate language] that is not tied to any operating system.
- Byte codes are interpreted only by the **JVM**. JVM is OS-dependent since it differs for different OS.
- Since these JVMs are made available across all platforms by **Sun Microsystems**, we can execute this byte code on any platform.
- A byte code generated in a **Windows** environment can also be executed in a **Linux** environment. This makes Java platform-independent.
- That’s why Java is called **WORA**.
- **WORA → Write Once, Run Anywhere**
